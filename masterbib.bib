  Abstract                 = {Microorganisms are sensitive to heavy metal pollution as are other components of the biota. However, most studies on the interactions between microbes and heavy metals have been conducted in synthetic media or in altered (e.g., sterilized) environmental samples and usually have used only single species. Few studies have evaluated the effects of heavy metals on the activities of natural heterogeneous microbial populations, both autotrophic and heterotrophic, in terrestrial and aquatic environments. These latter studies have shown that heavy metals inhibit primary productivity, nitrogen fixation, the mineralization of carbon, nitrogen, sulfur, and phosphorus, litter decomposition, and enzyme synthesis and activity in soils, sediments, and surface waters. The potential adverse effects of heavy metals on such microbe-mediated ecologic processes need to be incorporated into the methodologies used by regulatory agencies, such as the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, to prepare environmental risk assessments which, in turn, are used to formulate environmental criteria, such as the Water Quality Criteria, and to evaluate the safety to the environment of exposure to â€œnew chemical substances,â€� as mandated by the U.S. Toxic Substances Control Act of 1976. To provide appropriate data that can be assimilated into regulatory policy, it is essential that microbial ecotoxicity tests be standardized, are neither costly nor difficult to train personnel to conduct, and produce data that can be quantitated.},

  Abstract                 = {There is considerable interest in understanding the biological mechanisms that regulate carbon exchanges between the land and atmosphere, and how these exchanges respond to climate change. An understanding of soil microbial ecology is central to our ability to assess terrestrial carbon cycleâ€“climate feedbacks, but the complexity of the soil microbial community and the many ways that it can be affected by climate and other global changes hampers our ability to draw firm conclusions on this topic. In this paper, we argue that to understand the potential negative and positive contributions of soil microbes to landâ€“atmosphere carbon exchange and global warming requires explicit consideration of both direct and indirect impacts of climate change on microorganisms. Moreover, we argue that this requires consideration of complex interactions and feedbacks that occur between microbes, plants and their physical environment in the context of climate change, and the influence of other global changes which have the capacity to amplify climate-driven effects on soil microbes. Overall, we emphasize the urgent need for greater understanding of how soil microbial ecology contributes to landâ€“atmosphere carbon exchange in the context of climate change, and identify some challenges for the future. In particular, we highlight the need for a multifactor experimental approach to understand how soil microbes and their activities respond to climate change and consequences for carbon cycle feedbacks.},

  Abstract                 = {The continued increase in the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide due to anthropogenic emissions is predicted to lead to significant changes in climate. About half of the current emissions are being absorbed by the ocean and by land ecosystems, but this absorption is sensitive to climate as well as to atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations, creating a feedback loop. General circulation models have generally excluded the feedback between climate and the biosphere, using static vegetation distributions and {CO}2 concentrations from simple carbon-cycle models that do not include climate change. Here we present results from a fully coupled, three-dimensional carbonâ€“climate model, indicating that carbon-cycle feedbacks could significantly accelerate climate change over the twenty-first century. We find that under a 'business as usual' scenario, the terrestrial biosphere acts as an overall carbon sink until about 2050, but turns into a source thereafter. By 2100, the ocean uptake rate of 5 Gt C yr-1 is balanced by the terrestrial carbon source, and atmospheric {CO}2 concentrations are 250 p.p.m.v. higher in our fully coupled simulation than in uncoupled carbon models, resulting in a global-mean warming of 5.5 K, as compared to 4 K without the carbon-cycle feedback.},

Soil metagenomics, which comprises isolation of soil {DNA} and the production and screening of clone libraries, can provide a cultivation-independent assessment of the largely untapped genetic reservoir of soil microbial communities. This approach has already led to the identification of novel biomolecules. However, owing to the complexity and heterogeneity of the biotic and abiotic components of soil ecosystems, the construction and screening of soil-based libraries is difficult and challenging. This review describes how to construct complex libraries from soil samples, and how to use these libraries to unravel functions of soil microbial communities.},

The amounts of heavy metal added as chloride salts to the soils were 0, 55, 150, 400, 1000, 3000 and 8000 Î¼gÂ·gâˆ’1, respectively. The measurements were carried out both immediately after the addition of the heavy metals and approximately 18 months later. The inhibition during the first two to eight weeks was not obscured by an extra nutrient flush to drying. During the 18 months, the toxicity decreased but was still significant. Inhibition was greatest in the sandy soil and least in the clay soil. In a loam soil and in a sandy peat soil, the inhibiting effects were intermediate, but distinct. The main abiotic factors responsible for these different degrees of inhibition were the clay fraction for Cd, the Fe content for Cu, Pb and Zn and the {pH} for Ni. Although clay, Fe, and Mn together with the organic matter fraction, determine the total cation exchange capacity of soil, their contribution to the toxicity of heavy metals may be antagonistic. The latter may increase the mobility due to chelation and therefore possibly increase the toxicity, while the other factors may bind the heavy metals and therefore decrease the toxicity.},

  Abstract                 = {Tropical forest conversion, shiftingcultivation and clearing of secondary vegetation makesignificant contributions to global emissions ofgreenhouse gases today, and have the potential forlarge additional emissions in future decades. Globally, an estimated 3.1Ã—109 t of biomasscarbon of these types is exposed to burning annually,of which 1.1Ã—109 t is emitted to the atmospherethrough combustion and 49Ã—106 t is converted tocharcoal (including 26â€“31Ã—106 t C of blackcarbon). The amount of biomass exposed to burningincludes aboveground remains that failed to burn ordecompose from clearing in previous years, andtherefore exceeds the 1.9Ã—109 t of abovegroundbiomass carbon cleared on average each year. Above-and belowground carbon emitted annually throughdecomposition processes totals 2.1Ã—109 t C. Atotal gross emission (including decomposition ofunburned aboveground biomass and of belowgroundbiomass) of 3.41Ã—109 t C year-1 resultsfrom clearing primary (nonfallow) and secondary(fallow) vegetation in the tropics. Adjustment fortrace gas emissions using {IPCC} Second {AssessmentReport} 100-year integration global warming potentialsmakes this equivalent to 3.39Ã—109 t {ofCO}2-equivalent carbon under a low trace gasscenario and 3.83Ã—109 t under a high trace gasscenario. Of these totals, 1.06Ã—109 t (31\%)is the result of biomass burning under the low tracegas scenario and 1.50Ã—109 t (39\%) under thehigh trace gas scenario. The net emissions from allclearing of natural vegetation and of secondaryforests (including both biomass and soil fluxes) is2.0Ã—109 t C, equivalent to 2.0â€“2.4Ã—109 t of {CO}2-equivalent carbon. Adding emissions of0.4Ã—109 t C from land-use category changesother than deforestation brings the total for land-usechange (not considering uptake of intact forest,recurrent burning of savannas or fires in intactforests) to 2.4Ã—109 t C, equivalent to 2.4â€“2.9Ã—109 t of {CO}2-equivalent carbon. The totalnet emission of carbon from the tropical land usesconsidered here (2.4Ã—109 t C year-1)calculated for the 1981â€“1990 period is 50\% higherthan the 1.6Ã—109 t C year-1 value used by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. The inferred (= `missing') sink in the global carbonbudget is larger than previously thought. However,about half of the additional source suggested here maybe offset by a possible sink in uptake by Amazonianforests. Both alterations indicate that continueddeforestation would produce greater impact on globalcarbon emissions. The total net emission of carboncalculated here indicates a major global warmingimpact from tropical land uses, equivalent toapproximately 29\% of the total anthropogenic emissionfrom fossil fuels and land-use change.},

  Abstract                 = {Studies were carried out to evaluate the influence of Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb, or Zn on the decomposition of organic matter in soils and on their microflora. The heavy metals were added to samples of Gley soil and Light-colored Andosol at the level of 10 Î¼mol/g soil, respectively. Three days after the addition, sewage sludge was mixed with the samples at a 2\% rate. During the 4 week period of incubation at 28Â°C, {CO}2 evolution was measured periodically. At the end of the incubation period, the soil samples were analyzed to determine the number of bacteria and fungi, and the amount of heavy metals extracted successively with water and other reagents. The toxicity of heavy metals to soil microorganisms was also analyzed. The dilute suspensions of Gley soil and Light-colored Andosol were inoculated into albumin medium and rose bengal medium containing heavy metals of various concentrations, and the influence of the metals on colony formation by the bacteria and fungi was investigated. All the metals inhibited the {CO}2 evolution from both soils. However, the effect varied considerably among the metals and between the soils. {CO}2 evolution from the Gley soil was significantly lower than that from the Light-colored Andosol. Among the heavy metals, the effect exerted by Cd, Cu, and Ni was highly significant while that of Pb was the least significant. The toxicity of heavy metals to colony formation by soil bacteria was high for Cd and Cu, which inhibited {CO}2 evolution substantially. The amount of water-soluble heavy metals in the Gley soil was higher than that in the Light-colored Andosol, and the decrease in the {CO}2 evolution was associated with the increase in the amount of water-soluble heavy metals divided by the {ED}90 values of the heavy metals in relation to colony formation by the bacteria. These results indicate that the decrease of the inhibition of {CO}2 evolution by the heavy metals depended mainly on the degree of toxicity of the metals to soil bacterial growth and the amount of water-soluble heavy metals in soil.},
